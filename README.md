# P2-FizzBuzz
This project was created by Shelby Jorgensen for my CSCI-151 class, Programming with C++. With this project, we learned how to work with loops and conditions in C++. Below, I have attached the outline that was provided for this project.

Outline: Fizz buzz is a famous coding interview question designed to quickly filter out job candidates who know at least
the basics of programming. It presents a simple challenge, with just enough nuance to require a careful solution.
The objective is to count from one to one hundred, and replace certain integers that satisfy given conditions with
the words Fizz and Buzz. The conditions are as follows:
1. If the number is divisible by 3, replace it with the word Fizz.
2. If the number is divisible by 5, replace it with the word Buzz.
3. If the number is divisible by both 3 and 5 (ex. 15), then replace it with both words concatenated together -
FizzBuzz.

Project Requirements
1. Write a program that correctly solves the Fizz-buzz challenge.
You may not just hard-code the entire output, you should use a loop to iterate over the numbers
1..100.
2. Each number / word should be on exactly one line of output.
Note that when you have a multiple of both 3 and 5, the combined FizzBuzz should also be on just
one line.
